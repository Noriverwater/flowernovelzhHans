This is a English translation of the visual novel Flowers Blooming at the End of Summer, translated by Bing AI and GPT-4, edited by [GalTransl](https://github.com/XD2333/GalTransl/).

There are still many problems with the translation, however: some personal pronouns may be incorrect, and the subject of some sentences is incorrect. Some sentences are not quite fluent and some proper nouns are not harmonized. I'm hoping that someone who is a fan of this visual novel and familiar with English and Korean or native English speaker will be able to help with these problems.

You can take the translation and do whatever you'd like, such as improving the quality of the translation or making a English translation patch.
