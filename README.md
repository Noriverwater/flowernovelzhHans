# flowernovelJPtranslations

This is a Japanese translation of the visual novel Flowers Blooming at the End of Summer, translated by Bing AI, edited by [GalTransl](https://github.com/XD2333/GalTransl/).

The translation has good readability, and the grammatical structure, tone and Chinese character words correspond almost exactly to the original.

However, a serious problem is the inconsistency of personal pronouns across characters. I'm hoping that someone who is a fan of this visual novel and is familiar with Japanese and Korean will be able to help with this problem.

You can take the translation and do whatever you'd like, such as improving the quality of the translation or making a Japanese translation patch.
